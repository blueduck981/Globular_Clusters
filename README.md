# Globular_Clusters
Example codes for globular cluster abundance data manipulation.

combine_and_plot_m31.ipynb: takes final averaged abundance information for globular clusters from many files and creates a combined data frame.  The dataframe is used to make figures of abundance behavior.

make_pub_table_m31.ipynb: takes individual wavelength measurements for globular clusters that were previously stored by element in many files and combines them into one table for publication that is organized by wavelength.  Another table holding atomic information for each wavelength is joined to include in the final table.
